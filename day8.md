starting to feel the pressure of this class. I've also noticed that I haven't submitted a single reading assignment after I've completed them smh! I think I'm going to have to really sit down this weekend and just try to get a solid understand of what we've learned so far and keep practicing it. 

Im super glad we have that week long break so I could get more time to get all this stuff
